# ESP32_testbed

A program running on a ESP32 system on a chip to allow new sensors to be testing in conjunction with a [SignalK server](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server).

## IDE

The program relies on the [Platform IO IDE](https://platformio.org/) for development. 
[This instructable](https://www.instructables.com/Develop-ESP32-With-PlatformIO-IDE/) describes the use of Platform IO.

## Development platform

### Raspberry Pi

To install, follow the [PlatformIO installation instructions](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/index.html)

## Dependencies

The testbed program relies heavily on the library code developed for the [SensESP project](https://github.com/SignalK/SensESP). Read the
[Getting Started document](https://signalk.org/SensESP/pages/getting_started/) to setup your development environment. Typically, 
dependencies will be loaded automatically.
